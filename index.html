            efforts in
            Afghanistan, sending food,
            clean water, medicine, and other essential supplies to people in need. Once immediate needs are met, the
            fund will transition to support long-term recovery efforts led by local organizations in Afghanistan.</p>

                    addition to that, nonprofits such as women’s shelter charities also have wish lists.</p>
